The Lunh's Algorithm
--------------------
1. Generate a number with one digit less than the desired length. To generate a 16 digit card number, create a random number of 15 digits
2. Reverse these numbers
3. Replace every digit at odd place by its double - if the double is more than 9, use the sum of the digits in the double
4. Take sum of all the digits i.e. old digits at even places and new digits as odd places
5. Divide the sum by 10 and the reminder
6. Use this reminder as the last digit in the original nnumber in step# 1
7. This is the final valid card number
